CoralBlog is a personal project made by me, a blog with MySQL as database, Laravel as front and backend.
It is still a working in progress project, still not responsive, missing a account creation page.
It already has working comments, posts, front page with last posts, search and login, and admin account for creating and deleting posts and comments.
It is hosted on https://blogcoral.000webhostapp.com/ (having trouble with image upload on webhost, it forces the public folder to be renamed as public_html)
